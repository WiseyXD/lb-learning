# ⚙️ Load Balancer Implementation — Feature Roadmap

A **TypeScript-based Load Balancer** designed for scalability, resilience, and intelligent traffic distribution.  
This document outlines all planned **features and system behaviors**, categorized by functionality level.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The goal is to build a **custom load balancer** from scratch that mimics the essential capabilities of tools like **NGINX**, **HAProxy**, and **AWS ELB**, while being configurable, self-healing, and developer-friendly.

Each feature listed below describes **what should be built** and **what it should accomplish** — leaving implementation decisions open for flexibility.

---

## 🪜 1. Base Load Balancer

**Description:**  
Build a minimal HTTP proxy that serves as a single entry point for client requests.  
It should forward traffic to one or more backend servers and log request/response activity for visibility.

**Goal:**  
Establish a foundation for request routing and observability.

---

## ⚖️ 2. Load-Balancing Algorithms

**Description:**  
Implement multiple strategies to decide which backend should handle each request.

- **Random:** Distribute requests randomly across backends.  
- **Round Robin:** Sequentially cycle through backend servers.  
- **Weighted Round Robin:** Distribute requests based on assigned weights.  

**Goal:**  
Provide flexible load distribution strategies configurable via a single JSON file.

---

## 💓 3. Health Monitoring

**Description:**  
Create a background system to continuously check backend server health.  
Only healthy servers should receive requests.  
Display each server’s health status through logs or a dedicated endpoint.

**Goal:**  
Maintain traffic flow stability by isolating failing servers.

---

## 🔁 4. Retry and Failover Mechanism

**Description:**  
When a request fails, retry it on another healthy backend automatically.  
Include a configurable retry limit and timeouts to handle temporary network issues.  
Ensure graceful fallback behavior when all servers are down.

**Goal:**  
Increase reliability and minimize failed client requests.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Self-Healing System

**Description:**  
Develop a recovery mechanism for downed servers.  
Simulate or implement periodic rechecks and automatic restarts.  
Track and log recovery attempts with success rates.

**Goal:**  
Enable fault tolerance and automatic restoration of service health.

---

## 🔔 6. Webhook Notification System

**Description:**  
Add webhook-based notifications for important server events.  
Send alerts for:
- Single backend failure or recovery  
- Complete backend pool failure  

Each alert payload should contain a timestamp, affected server, and event type.

**Goal:**  
Provide real-time operational awareness for system administrators.

---

## ⚙️ 7. Configurable JSON Setup

**Description:**  
Centralize all runtime settings in a `config.json` file.  
Parameters include ports, server details, algorithms, retry counts, health check intervals, and webhook URLs.  
Validate configurations at startup for accuracy.

**Goal:**  
Enable full configurability and eliminate hardcoded logic.

---

## 🧾 8. Observability Layer

**Description:**  
Expose internal metrics and state through structured logs or an API.  
Include:
- Per-server request counts  
- Backend health summaries  
- Retry/failure statistics  

Optionally, implement a `/status` endpoint for live inspection.

**Goal:**  
Provide deep visibility into system behavior and performance.

---

## 🧠 9. Enhanced Health Checks

**Description:**  
Expand health checks to evaluate latency, status codes, and uptime trends.  
Implement adaptive backoff intervals for failing servers.  
Maintain a history of server health to identify unstable instances.

**Goal:**  
Enhance accuracy of health detection and reduce false positives.

---

## 🔒 10. Secure Communication

**Description:**  
Add optional SSL/TLS support for communication between the load balancer and backend servers.  
Allow configuration of both HTTP and HTTPS routes.

**Goal:**  
Ensure secure data transfer within internal server networks.

---

## 🌩️ 11. Dynamic Scaling

**Description:**  
Allow dynamic addition and removal of backend servers at runtime.  
Provide an API or hot reload mechanism to modify the backend pool without restarting the balancer.

**Goal:**  
Achieve elasticity and support on-the-fly scaling.

---

## 🧭 12. Dashboard / Visualization (Optional)

**Description:**  
Develop a simple web dashboard to visualize:
- Live backend health  
- Request distribution metrics  
- Webhook event history  

Display graphs or charts to represent load distribution and uptime.

**Goal:**  
Offer an intuitive UI for monitoring system health and activity.

## 🏁 Summary

| Category | Features |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Core** | Base Load Balancer, Algorithms, Health Checks |
| **Reliability** | Retry Logic, Self-Healing, Webhooks |
| **Advanced** | Dynamic Scaling, Secure Channels, Visualization |

### ✨ Vision
By implementing these features, the project will evolve from a basic reverse proxy into a **self-recovering, configurable, and observable load-balancing system** — all powered by **TypeScript**.

> Focus on building resilience first, then layering advanced capabilities gradually.
